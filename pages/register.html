                  <p>
                    If you supply personal information for the purpose of an
                    outreach activity organised by the University of Oxford
                    ("the University") (like Oxplore) and/ or its Colleges, some
                    of that information is added to the University's Higher
                    Education Access Tracker (HEAT) database (<a
                      href="http://www.heat.ac.uk"
                      >www.heat.ac.uk</a
                    >), which is used to record information about outreach
                    activities and those who take part in them. HEAT helps us
                    identify which activities are most helpful in preparing
                    students for higher education and progressing to employment.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This document describes how the information added to HEAT is
                    used by the University of Oxford and its Colleges (together
                    "we" or "us") as the "data controllers" for that
                    information. This means that we decide how to use your
                    information and are responsible for looking after it in
                    accordance with data protection legislation.
                  </p>

                  <h2>2. Glossary</h2>

                  <p>
                    Where we refer in this policy to your "personal data", we
                    mean any recorded information that is about you and from
                    which you can be identified. It does not include data where
                    your identity has been removed (anonymous data). Where we
                    refer to the "processing" of your personal data, we mean
                    anything that we do with that information, including
                    collection, use, storage, disclosure, deletion or retention.
                  </p>

                  <h2>3. Information collected about you</h2>

                  <p>
                    The information we hold about you on HEAT comprises the
                    following:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>name;</li>

                  <p>
                    We obtain this data when you take part in outreach
                    events/activities organised by the University (including its
                    Departments and Faculties) and/or the Colleges. Information
                    about your ethnicity is a special category of more sensitive
                    personal data and will only be held if you volunteered it
                    when you took part in an event/activity.

                    to higher education. Data from these sources will also allow
                    us to track your own educational journey from school to
                    higher education, for example, which university you end up

                  <h2>4. How we use the data on HEAT</h2>

                  <p>
                    We use the data in section 3 for the following purposes:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our
                      outreach programmes;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      producing statistics, including event application and
                      participation numbers, and participant outcomes; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      tracking future outcomes of event participants, including
                      applications to the University and other Higher Education
                      Institutions.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  Using your data for these purposes is necessary for tasks that
                  we carry out in the public interest (promoting and widening
                  access to Higher Education) and to meet our legitimate
                  interests in promoting applications to the University from
                  under-represented groups.

                  <p>
                    HEAT is a shared database used by a variety of organisations
                    to identify which activities are most helpful in preparing
                    students for higher education and progressing to employment.
                    Users of HEAT include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      departments and faculties of the University and Colleges
                      that organise outreach activities. They will have access
                      to your personal data contained in HEAT for the purposes
                      set out in Section 4 above.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      entities associated with the University, including student
                      led organisations such as OUSU and educational charities,
                      and your school, college and/or training organisation.
                      These organisations will only have access to your personal
                      data contained in HEAT if they were involved in organising
                      an outreach event which you attended.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  We may also share your data with HESA, UCAS, DfE and SFA to
                  help determine whether our activities are helping participants
                  move on from school into Higher Education and employment.

                  <p>
                    There may be occasions when the sharing explained above
                    involves the transfer of your data outside the EEA, for
                    example, to a service provider based overseas. Such
                    transfers will only take place if one of the following
                    applies:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      the country receiving the data is considered by the EU to

                    <li>the transfer has your consent;</li>
                    <li>
                      the transfer is necessary for the performance of a
                      contract with you or to take steps requested by you prior
                      to entering into that contract; or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      the transfer is governed by approved contractual clauses.

                  <p>
                    Providing high quality outreach activities means being able
                    to compare our activities and to determine which ones best
                    help students to move on to Higher Education and employment.
                    How long this takes will vary depending on your age at the
                    time of participation in an outreach activity. In order to
                    conduct long-term evaluation, tracking and research about
                    access to Higher Education, we will retain your data for as
                    long as we need it to meet the purposes set out above.

                    <li>
                      Request erasure of your data. This enables you to ask us
                      to delete or remove your data in certain circumstances,
                      for example, if you consider that there is no good reason
                      for us continuing to process it. You also have the right
                      to ask us to delete or remove your data where you have
                      exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Object to processing of your data where we are relying on
                      our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and
                      there is something about your particular situation which
                      makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Request the restriction of processing of your data. This
                      enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your
                      data, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy
                      or the reason for processing it.
                    </li>
                    <li>Request the transfer of your data to another party.</li>
                  </ul>

                  Depending on the circumstances and the nature of your request
                  it may not be possible for us to do what you have asked, for
                  example, where there is a statutory or contractual requirement
                  for us to process your data and it would not be possible to
                  fulfil our legal obligations if we were to stop. Further
                  information on your rights is available from the Information
                  Commissioner's Office (ICO).
