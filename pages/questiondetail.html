                    Florence Nightingale (known as the founder of modern
                    nursing) started the first formal nursing training in 1860.
                    At this stage, teaching tended to focus heavily on
                    etiquette, like how to be polite to your patients and dress
                    smartly. Even as recently as the 1970s, new nurses would
                    learn the large parts of the job from their ward sister.
                    Take wounds called bedsores for example: ward sisters would
                    treat them with anything from talcum powder to porridge! And
                    whatever your ward sister used, you would use too. Nowadays,
                    nursing is a graduate career, meaning you have to study a
                    three-year degree to become a qualified nurse. Nursing
                    degree apprenticeships are being developed in 2017 to offer
                    a flexible route into the profession.

                    Nurses work incredibly hard to keep their patients happy and
                    healthy, often working long hours and on weekends. But
                    before 1950, aspiring nurses had another commitment to make
                    when choosing the career: as a nurse, you were not allowed
                    to get married. Hospital nurses were all women. They lived
                    together in a home, which had to be kept tidy and was
                    inspected every day. Lights went out at 10pm in time for
                    bed! It might seem odd to us now for a career to determine
                    your lifestyle like that. With improvements in personal
                    transport and communications, nurses have since been given
                    more freedom like any other profession. This has included
                    men becoming registered nurses too, although currently only
                    around 10% of nurses in the UK are male.

                    Our ability to treat symptoms depends on the medicines and
                    machines we have available to us. In 1941, a new drug was
                    tested on humans for the first time. Penicillin, the worldâ€™s
                    first antibiotic (a drug that kills bacteria), was used to
                    treat an infected scratch. Although the patient didnâ€™t
                    survive, his medical team immediately saw the potential for
                    antibiotics to save millions of lives from infection.
                    Similarly, in the 1950s, dialysis machines were brought in
                    for patients with kidney failure, and ventilators were
                    invented for patients who couldnâ€™t breathe by themselves.
                    Together, these and other technology breakthroughs meant
                    that nurses no longer had to spend their working hours
                    sterilizing wards, performing lengthy procedures and
                    cleaning infected wounds - instead they could be treating
                    more complex diseases. Nowadays, nurses are able to
                    prescribe drugs and are trained to deal with a wide range of
                    diseases without needing a doctorâ€™s approval. They also
                    carry out research with patients, to help us understand how
                    to treat people better.

                    In the UK, life expectancy has been steadily increasing
                    since the mid-1800s. In just the last 100 years, life
                    expectancy has increased a huge amount, from 55 to 85 years.
                    Standards of living have improved, technology has boomed and
                    we have learned a lot about how different diseases work.
                    This means that people now survive the conditions they used
                    to die from, like the bacterial infections we now treat with
                    a just a few pills or an injection. There are more people
                    around in general, each with more health problems to be
                    treated. The impact of our ageing population on healthcare
                    is huge: since 2002/3 emergency hospital admissions have
                    increased by 1/3. Hospital treatments have become shorter
                    but more common: now a condition that would take a week to
                    treat can be cured in a day. Altogether, more people coming
                    into hospitals with more health problems means that nurses
                    have to see far more patients and deal with more complicated
                    needs.

                    Technology has huge power to help patients, and to change
                    how nurses interact with them. With access to the internet,
                    patients can access more information about their medical
                    condition, how their treatment works and why they use it.
                    They can also get support and advice from people in a
                    similar position, or expertise from a range of medical
                    professionals. This shift in where patients get their
                    information from has had a big impact on how nurses best do
                    their jobs. Now, nurses can help patients keep track of
                    their own medications and test results, giving them a
                    different role in a patientâ€™s care than simply administering
                    treatments. There is so much potential for technology in
                    healthcare and nursing, who knows what the next development
                    will be.
